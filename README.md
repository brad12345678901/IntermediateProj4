## To Install
To test the functions may require a couple of steps:
MOST IMPORTANT: must have a Metamask Wallet
  1. Go to Remix, a powerful ethereum IDE https://remix.ethereum.org/
  2. Import the only remaining solidity file.
  3. Connect to fuji network via Metamask by going to testnet.snowtrace.io and connect your wallet through there. It should prompt you to change your network to the Fuji Avalanche Network
  4. Go to https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c to get some AVAX token, and use the code "avaxstrong" or you could go here as well https://faucets.chain.link/fuji and select avalanche fuji
  5. Make sure your solidity compiler is at 0.8.20 then compile.
  6. Go to Deploy & run Transactions and select the contract "DegenToken - test.sol"
  7. Make sure also your EVM is set as Injected Provider, it should also show that you're on a custom (43133) network
  8. Input this 0x6b9B793F0ed0296eA3cd2D54FF13EF216cF98777 "at address" or you could deploy it as you wish if you want to test the functions because there are some functions that requires the owner to execute
  9. If you decided to deploy it yourself, a metamask ui may show up, make sure you have the fake AVAX coins in your account. Click confirm and the contract should be deployed
  10. Get the address of your contract and search it via the snowtrace IO
  11. Do some transactions and go wild!
